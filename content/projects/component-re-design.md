The Webapp, which provided the majority of Evident-Legal's sites, had become rather monolithic. I was tasked with exploring how front-end components could interact with RESTful services. I used AngularJS to rebuild our document storage component.

The document automation system we used was also cumbersome and inflexible. I used Angular2 to dynamically build an interview UI from a RESTful wrapper of the document automation system.
